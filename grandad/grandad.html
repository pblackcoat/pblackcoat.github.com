<p>Dear Charles -
<p>   Am in a rush as we are leaving on another trip tomorrow but want to get these off before departure -
<p>   Thought you might want to make some copies for Rich & Marge.  Spent 2 days w/ them in Colorado Springs & had a great time.  Thanks for calling & advising us of their temporary move - they love the Mtns & Marge is just "vacationing"
<p>   I am still looking for Dad's album I made for him but be patient -- we really have not been home enough to accomplish anything very well.  After mid-October should then be here for awhile - 
<p>            Love, Edna & Bruce
<p>   PS Had a great time @ home & was glad that for first time in ages was able to see Carla, Better, Jean & their husbands together - Bonnie could not make it.

<p>Dear Charles
<p>   It was so nice to hear from .  When you say your children are grown and married with children of their own it makes it seem a long time since I've seen you.
<p>   Your story of Bun tattleing on you boys is amusing.  It wasn't to you I can see, but Bun was always into something that netted trouble and he would be so glad to find someone else to blame for something.  He surely didn't set any example for good behavior.  I've often chuckled about our vanilla episode.  Bun died years ago.
<p>   Your trip up to N. J. must have been great fun.  Did you have the grandchildren with you?  I think it is so much fun to hear the comments from children.  They see everything so differently.  We enjoyed ours when they were little and now we have started on the next generation.  We have 4 grandchildren-- getting older fast. Shannon, the oldest, will be twelve and Aaron the youngest is 6.  Naomi is the next older than Aaron and Michah is olden then she.  They come through our yard to catch the school bus and I go out and stand by the road with them and hear all the news and the funny remarks.  The people across the road from us have saddle horses in thei pasture and they, our kids, have been trying to get acquainted with the horses.  We take little chunks of carrot and the children are learning that the horses won't bit their hands.  I'd like to try riding one some time but I'd probably be crippoed[sic]. Horses, these days, aren't for herding cattle and sheep or taking children to school.  They are just kept for entertainment.  Remember our trips to school on your folks saddle horse?  Oh, and the time when we were going to the Brady School and rode Bird?  I was pretty scaired[sic] when she galloped up the road between the banks of snow.  I think she had a phobia for narrow icy roads.  I had too.  At the time I didn't think aboiut that, I was too worried about what I could do if she didn't stop running.  I considered throwing you off into the snow bank.  LUuckily she got tired and slowed.  My main worry was that she would slip and we both would get caught under her.  When we had excitement it was for real.</p>
<p>   Do you r3member[sic] Jim DeVine stole the money your parents had to pay the hired man?  He must have been very busy watching every move around the place.  We weren't used to that kind of activity.  I don't know if Mr. Zea ever got anything out of his car or not.  It was used until he, Jim, ran out of oil, I think.  Then were were rattle snakes out on those north hills, and the neighbors cattle in the cornfield when your dad was in the hospital.</p>
<p>   There is a book, Bad River, Ripples, Rages, and Residents put out by the Bad River Womens Club and organized by Irene Caldwell.  I think she was Irene Preuse when she was a child.  I wish that I had allerted[sic] you boys to write something about your lives to add to the book but I didn't know that it would be quite such a volume.  Once before Evelyn McKim Ellis had a tiny little pamphlet about the people and it didn't amount to much I though.  Well the book tunred out quite good and the people that wrote for it remembered all the good things and forgot about the wild and discouraging things.</p>
<p>   Leonard and I have been through S/D several times.  We go to Minn to see Leonard's mother who is 100 years old this year.
