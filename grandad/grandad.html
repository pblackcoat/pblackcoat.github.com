Hi there! :)
	Haven't called 'cause I don't have a phone yet, but wanted to keep  in touch.
	Work's (Mark's?) ok, very dead here - no work.
	I got moved into a nice 4 room apartment and finally bought a day bed last week-end; had been sleeping on the floor.
	Went to see Anne Murray last week-end.  5th row seats.  It was great.
	I've met someone real special and it's working out beautifully.  And no, she's not another Betty White.  She's a chemist/engineer and we're real happy.
	Thaddeus and I are having dinner Monday night.  It'll be real nice to visit with him.
	(God I hate to write letters! Can you tell? ha ha)
	Here's my new address [REDACTED] Chgo Ill 60625
	Tell Bob "hi".  Write soon
			Love you, Nicki

Dear Charles -
	Am in a rush as we are leaving on another trip tomorrow but want to get these off before departure -
	Thought you might want to make some copies for Rich & Marge.
Spent 2 days w/ them in Colorado Springs * had a great time.  Thanks for calling & advising us of their temporary move - they love the Mtns & Marge is just "vacationing"
	I am still looking for Dad's album I made for him but be patient -- we really have not been home enough to accomplish anything very well.  After mid-October should then be here for awhile - 
		Love, Edna & Bruce
	PS Had a great time @ home & was glad that for first time in ages was able to see Carla, Better, Jean & their husbands together - Bonnie could not make it.
