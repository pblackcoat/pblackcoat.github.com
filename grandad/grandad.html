<p>Hi there! :)
	<p>Haven't called 'cause I don't have a phone yet, but wanted to keep  in touch.  
	<p>Work's (Mark's?) ok, very dead here - no work.
	<p>I got moved into a nice 4 room apartment and finally bought a day bed last week-end; had been sleeping on the floor.
	<p>Went to see Anne Murray last week-end.  5th row seats.  It was great.
	<p>I've met someone real special and it's working out beautifully.  And no, she's not another Betty White.  She's a chemist/engineer and we're real happy.
	Thaddeus and I are having dinner Monday night.  It'll be real nice to visit with him.
	<p>(God I hate to write letters! Can you tell? ha ha)
	<p>Here's my new address <b>[REDACTED]</b> Chgo Ill 60625
	<p>Tell Bob "hi".  Write soon
<p>			Love you, Nicki

<p>Dear Charles -
<p>	Am in a rush as we are leaving on another trip tomorrow but want to get these off before departure -
<p>	Thought you might want to make some copies for Rich & Marge.  Spent 2 days w/ them in Colorado Springs & had a great time.  Thanks for calling & advising us of their temporary move - they love the Mtns & Marge is just "vacationing"
<p>	I am still looking for Dad's album I made for him but be patient -- we really have not been home enough to accomplish anything very well.  After mid-October should then be here for awhile - 
<p>		Love, Edna & Bruce
<p>	PS Had a great time @ home & was glad that for first time in ages was able to see Carla, Better, Jean & their husbands together - Bonnie could not make it.
